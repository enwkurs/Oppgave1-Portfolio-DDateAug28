          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p>Hi, I'm Erin. I'm currently learning web development, focusing on HTML and CSS. I also make art and like finding ways to combine creative and technical work. This portfolio is a place for me to explore, experiment, and keep track of what I'm learning. I would like to get more comfortable working with layout, styling, and responsive design. I wrote this with help from AI because writing about myself is one of the things I am least comfortable doing.</p>

          <h2>Experience</h2>

          <p>Iâ€™ve been teaching myself HTML and CSS since I was about 12, starting with personal websites and profile customizations. I also have some experience with website builders such as Wix. I also do graphic design work using Photoshop, Procreate, and Canva.</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>

          <p>I'm interested in design for web and for print. I also enjoy making art both digitally and traditionally, as well as other creative crafts like sewing, sculpting, beading, and whatever else my ADHD latches onto. Outside of that, I like cozy games where I can build things, Halloween, and anything with stars, bats, or space themes. I tend to gravitate toward projects that let me experiment, customize, or make something that feels like my own.</p>
