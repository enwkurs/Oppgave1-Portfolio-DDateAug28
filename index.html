          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p>Hi, I'm <b>Erin</b>. I'm currently learning web development, focusing on <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. I also make art and like finding ways to combine creative and technical work. This portfolio is a place for me to explore, experiment, and keep track of what I'm learning. I would like to get more comfortable working with layout, styling, and responsive design.</p><hr>

          <h2>Experience</h2>

          <p>Iâ€™ve been teaching myself HTML and CSS since I was about 12 using GeoCities, starting with personal websites and profile customizations on a variety of social websites ( MySpace, LiveJournal, GaiaOnline, Tumblr, etc. ). I have some experience using modern "no code" website builders such as Wix and Weebly. Aside from web design, I also do <b>graphic design</b> work using Photoshop, Procreate, and Canva. I've created designs for web and print semi-professionally, both taking private commissions and working as an in-house designer for a cafe here in Bergen.</p><hr>

          <h2 style="align-self: flex-end;">Interests</h2>

          <p>I'm interested in design for both web and print. I also enjoy making art digitally and traditionally, as well as other creative hobbies like sewing, sculpting, beading, nail art, and whatever else my <b>ADHD</b> latches onto. Outside of that, I like cozy games where I can build things, halloween, and anything with stars, <b>bats</b>, or space themes. I tend to gravitate toward projects that let me experiment, customize, or make something that feels like my own.</p>
